[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

*The problem:* The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be
uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.
Is the distribution uniform?

*How I solved it:* I made a PMF of random numbers and then a CDF and plotted them both to compare.

'''
%matplotlib inline

#plot PMF
rand = [random.random() for x in range(1001)]
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Value', ylabel='Probability')

#Plotting CDF
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Percentile Rank', ylabel='CDF')
'''

*The solution:*

![Random PMF](C:\ds\metis\prework\dsp\statistics\PMF_random.png)
![Random CDF](C:\ds\metis\prework\dsp\statistics\CDF_random.png)

The fact that CDF random shows a linear result indicates a uniform distribution. Although the PMF also has a uniform distribution, it is much harder to visualize given the number of points and fluctuates; that is why CDF is more useful in this situation.
